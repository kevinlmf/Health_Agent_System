# Health_Agent_System

Unified Multi-Agent Health AI System - Four-Dimensional Health Analysis

## System Overview

Health_Agent_System is a **four-dimensional health AI system** that considers:
1. **Mental Health** - RLHF-optimized mental health support
2. **Physical Health** - Sports injury risk prediction
3. **Economic Health** - Economic factors affecting health
4. **Long-term Memory** - Health experience tracking

### Core Design Philosophy

- **LLM processes user speech** - Uses LLM to understand user language input, extract mental health and emotional information
- **Multi-modal models capture physical problems** - Uses multi-modal models (vision + text + sensors) to analyze physical issues
- **Economic factors consideration** - Considers income and country health profiles to provide practical health advice
- **Fully integrated** - All code is within the Health system, runs independently
- **Direct usage** - Works via CLI and Python code, no REST API service needed (REST API is future work)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinlmf/Health_Agent_System
cd Health_Agent_System
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API Keys

**Required**: The system uses LLM APIs for text processing. API keys are **required** for the system to work.

**Option 1: Use .env file (Recommended)**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys
```

**Option 2: Use system environment variables**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here  # optional
```
Get API keys from:
- Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys (recommended, system default)
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (optional)

### 4. Run the System

#### Method 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
python cli.py
```

Then follow the prompts to enter your health questions.

#### Method 2: Command Line Arguments
```bash
# Basic query
python cli.py -m "I've been feeling stressed lately"

# With economic information
python cli.py -m "I want to see a psychologist but worried about cost" --income 5000 --country CN

# With sports data
python cli.py -m "My knee hurts when exercising" --age 28 --training-load 0.8
```

```

**Purpose**: Provide personalized recommendations based on historical records, track long-term health changes



## Current Status

The system currently works via:
- **CLI Interface** (`cli.py`) - Direct terminal usage
- **Python Code** - Direct import and use in Python scripts

**No REST API service is needed or provided.** The system is designed to be used directly without HTTP endpoints.



## Future Work


1. **Complete Multi-modal Model Integration**
   - [ ] Full integration of vision models (CLIP, ViT) for image analysis
   - [ ] Sensor data processing pipeline integration
   - [ ] Multi-modal data fusion algorithm implementation

2. **Complete RLHF Implementation**
   - [ ] Complete RLHF training pipeline
   - [ ] User feedback collection mechanism
   - [ ] Personalized conversation strategy optimization

3. **Expand Country Health Profile Data**
   - [ ] Add more countries (Europe, Africa, Asia, etc.)
   - [ ] Real-time health data API integration


4. **Web Interface**
